    //hide the edit form
    //on click of the search button, validate the inputs
    //check to see if both a search term and category have been chosen
    //if not, show the specific error
    //how do you check to see the value of the select box?

    //on click of the create button,
    //hide the all tables form
    //show the add form
    //on click of the cancel button, empty values of all inputs and hide the form, and show the alldvds table
    //on click of the create dvd button, run ajax call to add to server.
    //after adding to the server, add the movie to the table and load the table. show the table of all dvds again.

    //Q: is there any kind of validation that needs to be ran on the individual entries of the create dvd form?

    //When you click on the edit button, it will hide the all dvds table
    //then we will run the ajax call to the server to get the item by the id number
    //and fill in the inputs of the edit form to match the results of the call
    //then it will show the edit form

    //on clicking the cancel button of the edit form, empty the values of all inputs
    //hide the edit form
    //show the all dvds table div

    //on clicking the save changes button, run ajax call to put to server the new values
    //probably run whatever validation first.
    //you will need to make sure that the user did not enter something blank for the title. Check for whitespace.

    //on clicking the delete button, get the id that is "hidden" in it.
    //make the modal show up, but pass this hidden id to it.
    //when you press the button in the modal, run the ajax call with the id to DELETE the dvd.
    //on finishing the call, close the modal.
